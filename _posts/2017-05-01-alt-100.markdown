title:  The Alternate 1r00
summary: Thinking about the media deemed an "enemy of the state" that we've gotten into the habit of attacking people for disagreement, that some people want a seperate set of facts for the right and the left, and other gnarly ways we fight to confirm our biases, I decided to gather the news from a conservative perspective and compare that with a more mainstream perspective.

When President Trump called the media an [Enemy of the State][enemy], I first cringed, then grew quite angry, then quite scared. I cringed to be treated as a juevenille, then angry at teh direct assault on civility, then scared that grown adults...



to think how civility was being assaulted directly, and finally scared that grown adults actually believe that an independent media that's allowed to print almost anything they want is actually bad for society.  I've read propaganda from other parts of the world that should scare any civil-minded adult. But here we are.

were It's not about having a political belief accepted or rejected by the media, it's about whether we can have a free society without independent review. The short answer is we can't.  Still, this idea persists that the liberal media is a downfall to US society and conservative propaganda is produced to address this.
