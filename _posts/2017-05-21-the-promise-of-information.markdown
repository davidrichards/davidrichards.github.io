title:  The Promise of Information
summary: Our data sources are growing at such a rate that it boggles the mind, robbing us of the real promise of information. Our social media and search algorithms are amazing and improving, but that's not all there is. Contextual information, the kind of information that reliable, complete, and compelling is still lacking, leaving us in a flurry of busy work with less material gains made.  A better system embraces complexity and all of the steps it takes to create clarity.

Starting with complexity, where do we go?  Say I'm interested in the conflict in Syria, the displacement of refugees, the casualties, and factions in the region.  My search starts with the stakeholders on the field. What are all the things I would want measured?  Who is measuring them? Is this information reliable? What exactly does this information contain? What is it lacking? What specific outcome do I expect from my engagement with this information?

After I'm clear about what I want, having explored the terrain, created a strategy for traversing it, refined my moves that I'm confident that each step I need to take to answer an question as ambitious as the conflict in Syria is necesary and important, I know that I can avoid the unnecessary nuances, leaving markers to come back another time and explore further, I am free to dive into the actual data engagement.  Some people call this work data engineering but I prefer to call it data orchestration, using known and reliable processes, enhancing the data with the geographic, temporal, and otherwise contextual data I have been preparing for just this occassion, and many others like this, collaborating with analysts of all sorts, ensuring the whole engagement comes together fully.  And it is about the finale, seeing how every part came together, knowing the final delivery is whole and complete, that makes it all worth the effort.

This is why so much of the promise of information falls short. It takes real work and real respect to get these things done. Until we let ourselves freely engage in these kinds of activities, we'll never keep our promise to be the informed generation, acting on insight, avoiding the pitfalls of misinformation, incomplete information, or misapplied information.  Presented correctly, data fit becomes immediately apparent, no longer hiding with Waldo, one answer as likely as the next, but information that can anticipate questions, express itself credibly, rely on the makers of the data to easily back it up.

This is less Utopian than it sounds, once the engagement has been setup correctly. Fortunately, most of the hardest parts of the data engagement can be automated.  It requires clarity from complexity, a two-way conversation around our current understanding and the understanding we'll need to deliver the goods.  Done right, this conversation doesn't have to be much more complicated than ordering at a fast food restaurant, although its impact is of course much more meaningful than just the size of my waist line.
