Yesterday I was frustrated with a set of applications I had been working on.  I hadn't been working in the front end, and I didn't need to keep that part of my development environment up to date.  I whined like a junior programmer about every little thing.  It took over half the day and five people to get me where I needed to be to get a simple feature tested.

Today I had a dependency problem with a project.  Again this was front-end development.  Working with it for most of the day had me wondering if I needed to build something different and simpler.  I was amazed, as I re-installed all my Node packages how many deprecation warnings I had.  It takes 858 Node dependencies to effectively put 3 HTML pages online right now.

Admittedly, I had what I thought was a pretty sweet workflow setup.  Webpack could get me ES6 support, source maps, HTML building, CSS and Sass support, all the React goodies with Alt and many many other things.  I was sure that I had come up with a reasonably sharp approach to the things I wanted to deliver.

And, I'm not saying that these are bad technologies.  I'm saying that this has become incredibly complex.  On a good day, without deadlines, I'd still be impatient with how much actual work goes into a modern web application.

Maybe I'm spoiled.  When the web really found it's stride in my part of the world, I had been developing for a while.  Nobody tried to put their best work online, just share some information and documents up there.

When Rails came around, I had been busy writing an MVC framework out of PHP to put an application together.  I realized I was never going to build something as productive so I zipped up my project, along with about 1,000 hours of my time, and never looked back.  I learned to write a lot of interesting applications with Rails.

Node turned my head, and still has a lot of great technologies.  The world has put a lot behind this technology.
