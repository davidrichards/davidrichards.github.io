"Are we there yet?"

This is the whine from the backseat of many road trips.  Maybe you've been on some of these?  I have, both as the driver and the impatient child.  It's hard for a child that doesn't have as strong a sense of time or patience to sit still and enjoy the journey.  Without having anything to do, it's even harder.

As a parent, I've learned to patiently set the context with my children as we prepare for a trip.  I then talk to them about what we're doing, how far along we've made it, and interesting things we're passing.  Well, they're interesting to a dad anyway.  With an ongoing conversation, at least the time passes quickly and I don't get asked that question.

Thinking about it today, I realize that "Are we there yet?" is a euphemism for, "I don't want to travel with you any longer."  The journey just doesn't seem worth it at those moments.

I think this is true in our business life as well.  A leader needs to sell the team on where we are going and how we'll get there.  In fact, if they haven't done this, very little else really matters.

It's even worse with software developers.  We are problem solvers by craft.  Until we're sold on where we're going, we naturally treat it as an unsolved puzzle and often get carried away trying to do the leader's job for them.  It's an advanced form of [nerd snipping](https://xkcd.com/356/).

So, for software developers, they need to be assured (often) that the problem isn't the organization, the product or anything else.  The problem is a particular set of prioritized issues and features.  If that's not known, the problem is figuring those out.  Software developers can reason with product owners about whether a customer will notice a feature or whether a bug is critical or minor.  It's not really a negotiation, just a little bit of information needs to be shared.

This is important for productivity.  It's also important for cost management.  Engineering is usually one of the most expensive parts of a project, some of the riskiest components, so getting engineers to push along is critical.

### So, why is it so hard for most companies to figure this out?

It's rare, in my experience, to actually get a team to work together and move in the same direction.  And, we don't live in an autocratic society.  Right now, it's usually pretty easy for a developer to leave a company and get a job at higher pay.  There just aren't enough software developers for current demand.  So, trying to control every aspect of a person's thinking and loyalty is a futile experience.  Only the insecure will stick around in the face of utter control.

What I've seen work is respecting why the key players are at the table.  As in all things, [never delegate understanding](http://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/never-delegate-understanding/).  A leader can't wield knowledge they never had.

A particularly loyal employee told me why he was willing to stay so long at a troubled company.  "The CEO never failed to appreciate my particular skill set.  After that, of course I'd do anything he asked."  The leader knew why this person was at the company, what brought him fulfillment and clarity.  The CEO honored that, and this talented human moved mountains for him.

As a counter example, I once had a particularly caustic conversation with a superior at my organization.  He could scarcely cover the disdain he had in his voice for the solution I had delivered.  He openly mocked me in a room full of people, insinuating that I didn't know what I was talking about.  This man has never delivered a full working system in his life, not at the scale and quantity that I do.  He has never stuck with a project until it was finished.  He has never built a team or developed another person's talent so that they are successful.  There had been a minor bug that could be fixed in a couple lines of code, but he wanted to drag me out and make an example of me.  He had hoped to convince me of some other way of seeing a problem, and instead ensured that I would not only leave his team, but would ever remember him as a terrible example of leadership.  All for a minor bug that was fixable in 10 minutes.

Even now, thinking about the experience, the story sounds fantastic.  Surely there was more going on?  Probably.  Could it have been worked out?  Probably.  It may have been deserved or fair. But notice how I remember the incident.  The conversation went from discussing code to evaluating the worth of this individual.  Right or not, this leader lost a follower.  A lot of potential good was destroyed in a moment.  At the very least, I had to conclude that this relationship doesn't work in this context.

### This isn't about culture

Notice how, in my opinion, the answer is to get someone that sees where a leader is going and wants to pitch in.  **It's not about creating culture.**  Despite all the hype, culture is a cheap substitute for strategy.

That means it's not about who's in charge.  It's not about leadership style.  It's not about casual Fridays.  **It's about wanting to be part of the core purpose of a team.**  And, in my experience, wanting to be part of that purpose is a lot easier and cheaper than trying to manufacture culture.

That's because when we get a job, we almost always developed some real talent to be there.

Developers paid an incredible price to be at their desks.  For me, it was attending lots of school, reading hundreds of books, spending near 80,000 hours of practice (I'm a workaholic, and I'm less and less proud of that as I grow older).  I had to really want to be there, and my experience isn't unique.

We worked incredibly hard to get there.  We have incredibly critical reasons to be there.  Use that to get someone to care about where you're going, and you're a leader of software developers.

### This really is an issue

These economic times, until something breaks, are hyper difficult.  Salaries are growing at around 6% per year ([roughly](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/web-developer-salaries-2016/)).  This at a time when inflation is [roughly flat](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/).  How can someone hold onto a team when almost anyone can cross the street to another shop for a $10,000 annual pay bump?

On the other hand, believing in where we are going and having some ownership of the solution is the easiest cure.  I'm not talking about equity or options.  I'm talking about just letting people deliver worthwhile contributions and thinking them for it.  If it can be improved, just do it respectfully.  If you don't think you can be tactful or respectful, invest a couple minutes preparing for potentially team-killing conversations.
