"Are we there yet?"

This is the whine from the backseat of many road trips.  Maybe you've been on some of these?  I have, both as the driver and the impatient child.  It's hard for a child that doesn't have as strong a sense of time or patience to sit still and enjoy the journey.  Without having anything to do, it's even harder.

As a parent, I've learned to patiently set the context with my children as we prepare for a trip.  I then talk to them about what we're doing, how far along we've made it, and interesting things we're passing.  Well, they're interesting to a dad anyway.  With an ongoing conversation, at least the time passes quickly and I don't get asked that question.

Thinking about it today, I realize that "Are we there yet?" is a euphemism for, "I don't want to travel with you any longer."  The journey just doesn't seem worth it at those moments.

I think this is true in our business life as well.  A leader needs to sell the team on where we are going and how we'll get there.  In fact, if they haven't done this, very little else really matters.

It's even worse with software developers.  We are problem solvers by craft.  Until we're sold on where we're going, we naturally treat it as an unsolved puzzle and often get carried away trying to do the leader's job for them.  It's an advanced form of [nerd snipping](https://xkcd.com/356/).
