Not every painting I've ever painted is remarkable. Not even a mother has patience for the thousandth thoughtless thing. What's remarkable is something someone shares. Why do people share things? For their own reasons.

It makes them look smart. They think others will laugh too. It makes their point better than they could.

Good work is like camera work. It directs people's attention respectfully.

I don't know if those images are remarkable, but I like them. It's interesting to see things keep going. Life, uh, finds a way. The only reason that would be remarkable is if someone was trying to make a point and found these images, or they really wanted to find some solace in nature and these images did something for them. I imagine really good photography can do that--photos that took some thought and preparation, or at least a little luck. 

What I do is work on systems. I create harmony where there was chaos. I find smart ways to simplify unruly systems. If I were to remark on them,that's not remarkable. If I were to show other people how to make their lives less chaotic, that may be. Notice how the camera turns away from me and to something that makes someone else look smart/funny/relevant?

Relevant to the audience is not a natural perspective. I like how Lisa Ko learned it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">everything I know about about story plot, scene sequencing, and rate of revelation I learned from years of obsessive mixtape making</p>&mdash; Lisa Ko (@iamlisako) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamlisako/status/1257426014885552134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

She obsessively made mixtapes that others could listen to. She knew how they would feel listening to those songs. She knew what they meant to her, but also how others might feel. Making something remarkable means making mix tapes for people like me, giving them something they can celebrate about themselves.
