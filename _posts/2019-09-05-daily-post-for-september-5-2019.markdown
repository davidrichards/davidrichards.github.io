# Rough Cuts

I've been using the slip box method for a while now, a method started by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist. He wrote 58 books and hundreds of articles in 30 years. His approach was simple:

* Read with a pen and paper, taking temporary notes.
* Create a set of bibliographic references.
* Copy temporary notes to a permanent location, with reference annotations.
* Collect notes for project files.

I've created a command line tool that combines IA Writer, Dropbox, and some code I wrote to organize my slips in an easy-enough way to create and organize them. What I haven't been doing is releasing much of what I'm learning. On a typical day, I read at least a few articles and have some worth-it-to-me notes on the things I read. I've decided to release these notes here, to give myself a chance to reflect on what I'm learning.


## Other Approaches

There are many other ways of doing this work, none of them are as satisfactory. For example, creating topics or other static organization creates complexity and requires me to know more than I can know right now.

Getting Things Done is an approach for business and startup culture. It doesn't extend well to research and creative work because it requires that I break down problems to their smallest component. I don't know what the smallest component is, and frankly it's a distraction to try and guess.

## WRITER

Another approache to the slip box method is WRITER, from Shaunta Grimes. WRITER: Writing, Reading, Ideation, Talking, Exercising, and Regrouping.

A good day could look like write fiction, read fiction, make a list of ten ideas, talk to someone I don't live with, exercise, review my day and play for tomorrow. The important thing is it takes a practice to keep the system going. Also, like the slip box method, these are tiny goals. You can skip an hour's worth of work. Everything on the list can be done in ten minutes each.

## Creative Writing and Slip Box

It's not enough to research. I am a writer. I work with fiction and poetry to learn and express myself. The Slip Box supports creative writing by organizing my research, permanently storing observations, and simplifying tasks.

Ideally, I should be able to even organize stories this way, outlining beats, scenes, sequences, and whole stories. I should be able to track open questions and organize the tools I can setup before I start to write.

# Data Work and Slip Box

I should be able to organize my data work this way too. Many data scientists have a closed approach to their data work, much like stale study guides that suggest starting with a blank sheet of paper, with a hypothesis, or some other interruption to the work.

Smart work takes one step at a time. It is scalable. It takes linear effort to extend it. This type or organization reduces distraction and should work well.

The actual code, the Jupyter notebooks, libraries, models, data, operations, platforms, and other tools I use for my data work can be organized like project files. It is not different than creating permanent slips and writing at most a preliminary draft from my notes.

# Intelligence Can Be Simple

Intelligence is generally awareness and functionality, rather than IQ or some external measure.

That means I can measure whether organizing slips increases awareness. Can I find them? Can I understand them after I forgot the context when they were written? Can I address any part of my  research? Can I keep an open mind? Can I form opinions? Can I ask questions, make arguments, change my opinions?

That also means I can measure whether organizing slips increases functionality. Can I manage more complexity? Can I find what I'm looking for? Do I have serendipitous insight by combining new things? Is it easy to extend old ideas with new information?

# Data Work Is Never Complete

Like with software, a data project is never finished until I shut it down. That doesn't mean I keep working on it, but there can be new arguments, problems with new data, new questions, or new methods to apply to old systems.

Better to find the tools that use old approaches and update them together. Better to consider what could be different without disrupting what's already working. Better to remain calm when difficult choices and presentations are appropriate.

# Context Free Discussion

A context-free discussion of verifiable facts is promising. Consider a slip as an answer in a question and answer NLP task. A lot of great next steps can come from putting my best work out there, making it available for data tools.

Bringing the whole conversation full circle is critical. A lot of data work isn't about creating the most accurate models, but scaling them, collaborating with others, adapting good ideas in the organization, finding latent variables, and training people to continue and improve the effort. All of that can be enhanced by high quality slips.

# Writing Has Many Steps

Writing involves reading, research, thinking, and tinkering. The slip box method splits these steps into different time slots, making it easier to do one thing at a time. Also, it makes it easier to do a step when I'm ready, instead of when I start the first step. 

Any thought of sufficient complexity requires writing—memory and logic are limited resources. By writing, I seek coherence by creating distance between each step.

(Ahrens, 2018)

# Results

With slip box, I keep revisiting areas I couldn't master before, thinks like port forwarding, VPNs, security, and non-FastAI machine learning. These are areas I can't focus my career on, but are an important foundational part of my research. It's worth taking the effort.

The difference is the process. Rough notes begin to make sense. I filter these and convert some of them into permanent notes. I can search, link, order, organize, and refine the permanent notes. This means something is only important if it's important—if it fits into my life, and moves things forward for me.
