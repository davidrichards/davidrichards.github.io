summary: Some of the most exciting things that I've done are done on the ground floor.

Right now, I'm backing a Kickstarter for a game, [En Route](#).  It's exciting to know the game developer.  It's exciting to see how it plays.  I love that I received a print and play zip files from the game creators this morning (I can print out the game myself and play it with my family or share it with my friends).  What's so exciting?

Part of it is the conversations.  How did you develop the game?  What insights have you gained from building this (they've actually created 3 games, and have many more planned, Nathan and Jake are a dynamic duo)?  How did you get it manufactured?  How are you doing your marketing?  It's like I have a front-row pass to a televised game.  It's fun for everyone, but more fun to be up close and personal.

I've had that experience a lot of times in my career.  I was there on day 1 when Capital Media opened their doors.  Everyone left their jobs and we had some funding and a ton of work to handle.  We got to hear the founders' vision (over and over ad nauseam eventually, but it was a blast the first 100 times I heard it).  We were young and invincible and on board for whatever came next.  A lot came next, and they eventually shut their doors, but not before they were able to produce some really worthwhile products first.

I was also there on day 1 (ish) at Instructure when we got to start building the prototype.  Now that they're far from being a founder's company (they're public now and off to meet other challenges), a lot of the more-interesting-to-me stories are kind of washed from the Internet.  On their careers page they have this right now:

> Instructure was founded in 2008 by two computer science grad students who got their start with a Geo Metro, a big idea, and an instructor / mentor / techpreneur who thought they might be on to something.

What I remember of that is Devlin had wanted to be an entrepreneur and brought Brian to a class at BYU taught by Josh Coates (their current CEO).  He came to the class with 20 ideas or so, all of which they knocked out as a bad fit for Silicon Valley-style startups.  So, he went to Josh with the dilemma.  Josh asked what was the worst piece of software they use every day.  Blackboard.  "OK, kill Blackboard."  So, they maxed out their student loans, borrowed a Geo Metro and took a tour to validate their ideas of how to build a better product than Blackboard's.

They came home with data, showed Josh, impressed him enough that he told them he'd make sure they got funded.  He started taking them around to investor meetings for seed capital and were finally told that if they had a prototype, that person would invest immediately.  Josh wrote them a check for $25,000 and 10 minutes later Devlin called me.  We started building the prototype the next morning.

Now that was a lot of excitement as well.  We had incredible deadlines.  We needed to squish my undisciplined mind into a fairly narrow perspective to get more done with the resources we had.  That sounds nice when I put it that way, but what it looked like was sometimes heated discussions that probably felt like raising a teenager to Brian and Devlin.

On the ground floor, it takes a very different perspective.  We have to know what we're up to, why we're doing it, have a vision of what it's all about but not lose track of the day to day deliveries.  It's the way that change is made in this world, or at least one very important way.

I've been on the ground floor quite a bit.  I was there near enough to day 1 for several companies: Ubalo, Castle, Orb 4.  Ubalo sold to Twitter, Castle is doing great without me (and probably happier without grumpy-old-me), Orb 4 went down in a fire of fraud and embezzlement (bastards).  I probably should tell more stories about what it's like to do that for people that want to try their hand at starting companies.

I've also been involved in later-stage companies that still had that startup feel.  Nuvi is doing that right now.  They've been around for about 5 years, grow like mad, don't often feel stodgy like most of corporate America and need people to come in and deliver their best for the company to thrive.

I'm also burning all the midnight oil I have for School Wealth.  I'm ground level on this one (co-founder, CTO).  It's a crazy and wonderful ride.  Decisions matter.  Delivery matters.  Careful use of resources matter.

The thing that's completely pure and wonderful at this stage is the dream.  What we can do is powerful.  I often would rather try and figure out the problems school districts are facing than sleep or goof around.  There is a wealth of data, a need for simple and powerful tools for school administrators, and a world of possibility after that.
