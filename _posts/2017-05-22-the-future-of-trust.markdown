The future addresses trust, allowing a trust-but-verify approach to working with each other. This isn't new, we've been doing it for a while, finding ways to trust transactions and deliver goods and services with smart contracts. The block chain has a lot to do with this, adding layers of verifiability to our interactions.  The consequences of this are less urgently discussed outside of the relatively small circles of block chain enthusiasts.  Let me show you how I see things today.

In an easy to verify world, I can delegate finer parts of a project to more people because I can confirm they are delivering the things I needed from them.  In this way, I can collaborate with more people on more things.

In an easier to trust world I can involve people more easily in my work. A lot of how we hire and collaborate involves our personal networks. It's expensive to work with people that let us down, it's expensive to exclude people that are less like us. This costs us in diversity of participation, thought, creativity, and options.
